TO DO:
    Packet Seq and Ack seq is supposed to be either 1 or 0!!
    Server is not supposed to send another packet until the last is ACKed
    Clean up the code on client side.
    Make functions rdp_connect, and recv_data for client in rdp file
    Make sure I'm checking all return values where that is needed.
